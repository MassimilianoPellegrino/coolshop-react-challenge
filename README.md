## Coolshop React Challenge by Massimiliano Pellegrino

A simple React calculator that sums numbers between them and shows the result of the calculation, updating it "live" while the user interacts with the app.

In particular, the user can:

- Add and remove the rows that contain the numbers.
- Change each row number and/or sign.
- Disable rows so that the corresponding numbers don't contribute to the addition (while still allowing the change of the row values).

### `yarn`

Installs the app's dependendencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
